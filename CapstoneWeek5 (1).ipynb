    "A few friends have recently started a Russian restaurant in Baltimore, which is located 60 km away from Washington, DC. The restaurant has done very well and they have begun thinking about trying to expand into the Washington area. They are confident that the restaurant can do equally as well if not better in the Washington area. However, this type of branching out would be a very big leap for the company and is critical to their success. However, if the new restaurant fails, this could be detrimental to their original restaurant and possibly cause it to take severe losses or even close down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the magnitude of this decision, the group wants to do everything they can to make sure they are absolutely confident about opening up the new restaurant. One of the most important tasks with opening up a new restaurant is figuring out the location of this new restaurant. They would like to have a quick, efficient, and overall smart way to find a good location to possibly place the new restaurant. Traditional ways of trying to find a suitable area may take too long or may not be as accurate (contacting a real estate agent, checking local listings, etc). So the group decided to reach out to a data scientist to help them find the best location for the new restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to find the best location for the restaurant is to classify areas in Washington as \"clusters\" based on similar traits. Features such as types of venues and most popular venues in these areas will help the group identify similar neighborhoods, which will then help the group decide which area is more suitable for the new restaurant. From there, they can decide on specific locations."

    "Like stated in the introduction, we will have to break Washington up into different areas within the city. After breaking Washington up into these areas, we can further analyze them for types of venues to determine their similarities to each other. How similar they are will determine which cluster (or \"group\") they get put into. Once you determine which cluster each area belongs to, then you can decide which are the most optimal to place the new restaurant based on the group's criteria.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step is to find location data for the city of Washington, including zip codes, latitudes, and longitudes. We were able to find a free downloadable online source containing location data for all zip codes in the US, the only stipulation being that we had to mention the source providing this data. You can download the same data from https://simplemaps.com/data/us-zips . While the file contains many attributes for each zip code, we will only be focusing on zip code, latitude, longitude, city, county, and state. Using this information, we will then use Foursquare API to see types of venues and specific venues within these zip codes to help determine the clusters. We will also be using K-means classification to determine the optimal number of clusters, as well as the accuracy for each cities relation to the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of this data will be similar to the analysis done in the Segmenting and Clustering Toronto neighborhoods lab. Gathering all of the location data for a city, clustering the neighborhoods within that city, leveraging Foursquare API to determine number of venues and types of venues within each neighborhood, and using that to determine which cluster each neighborhood belongs in is how we completed that lab and how we will complete this analysis."

As a reminder, our overall objective is to identify the best cluster to select. We will use that best cluster as a guidance and as a list of zip codes to target for our stakeholders to begin finding areas for the new Persian restaurant. So, via reviewing the clustering results, we will estimate the similarity inside each cluster and unsimilarities between two clusters. It will be a key phase when we work with the client and have a shared understanding of the results. In case of more clarity needed, or if we need to get our results more solid, we can run k-means for other values of k and explore further."

    "This re-affirms that we will choose cluster 0 as our cluster, which will determine the exact zip code where the new Russian restaurant will go. After we run our kmeans algorithm for many values of k (from k=1 to k=20), we see that the more discriminating result is with k=7. Number of points per cluster for k=7 {0: 45, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 0} We'll explore the results in the Results section of this report. At this stage we realized that the number of clusters was crucial in the way our kmeans algorithm could actually efficiently do some classifying tasks. We've also seen how we had to work on the features we extracted got with the Foursquare API to make more relevant features to solve our problem. It is both thanks to working on many values of k for kmeans and thanks to features modifications that we could reach the results we present in the next section of our report."
